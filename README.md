### 🌍 About Me

🚀 I'm currently enrolled in the **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Programme** where I’m mastering core backend technologies and software engineering principles.

💡 What got me into software engineering was a deep passion for solving real business problems. I love building **solutions that help businesses connect better with their customers**—through performance, design, and conversion-focused interfaces.

🎯 My mission is to **build web apps that not only work—but *convert*.** I enjoy developing backend systems that are robust, scalable, and user-centric.
